// Currently I have not included an API key, or UN and PW to the connectToMovieDB.java class.
// I can not use my gvsu email account as I am not able to gain access for what ever unresolved 
// reason additionally my other account has private information on it at this time. Dan or Taylor, 
// if you could include that information from an account if you have time that would be great. 
// if not I can generate another account I would just need to create another email account and I 
// am trying to avoid that if possible. 
// Also if you have any questions about the code flow that is currently there please let me know. 

// Thanks
